# UNIX_Utilities
This project replicates some of the most commonly used UNIX commands with simplified functionality. These utilities are intended to serve as educational examples of how UNIX command-line tools operate. The tools are designed to work in a Linux environment and provide fundamental operations like listing files, displaying file content, pattern searching, and basic file manipulation.
